            made collectively, and everyone shares the risk and the reward.

                whether you're a skilled tradesperson, designer, or investor ‚Äî
                is welcome.

                Projects vary, but many start with members contributing between
                ‚Ç¨2,000‚Äì‚Ç¨5,000 each. Every project is its own entity, so members

                Nope! Some members bring hands-on skills and equipment, others
                contribute money, design work, admin, or coordination. We build
                around everyone‚Äôs strengths.

                Equally ‚Äî if 10 people contribute evenly to a project, they all
                split profits evenly. You decide as a team how to run it.
